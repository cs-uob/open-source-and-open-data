#+title: Open Source and Open Data Research Group Meeting Notes
#+author: Joseph Hallett, François Dupressoir, Awais Rashid, Miquel Perello Nieto and Inah Omoronyia

* <2024-04-25 Thu 11:00> Inaugral Meeting

- Joseph is working group leader.

- What do we want to do?
  - Why do we care? What is /open/ and /good/ research and why is it desirable
    - Well because funders like it... as well as researchers
    - What are the requirements for it from:
      - funders?
      - conferences?
      - researchers?
  - Defaults as part of guidance
    - What's the benefit of doing various things?
    - What's the benefit of various licenses?

- Are we making research /open/ or /reproducible/ and are they really the same thing?

- What sort of things are there and whose doing the current guidance?
  - Datasets :: ESRC
  - Sourcecode :: Github I guess?
  - Artefacts :: ???
  - ? Study design :: OSF

- Could we provide a reference implementation for how to do all this stuff?
  - Ooh that sounds like a good idea!
  - ...and we should probably write a paper about how we came to it!

- There is a Git repo for everything on the school Github account
  - Is Github /really/ open source though?
  - We should really put all our notes in it.
    - See _this_.

- We should review whats the current /state of the art/
  - Practices
  - Processes
  - Training initiatives
  - ...isn't this basically what we were saying earlier about looking at whats in the current guidance?
  - What about things like Jupyter notebooks?
    - Code goes in PURE
    - Data goes in RSDF
    - Isn't it frustrating there is no single source for this?

- Lets put all the notes from this working group online!
  - Open Source our process for designing what open research should look like!
  - Eat our own dog food!
  - But should we really do that? Who cares?
    - You don't have to look at it but if we're gonna recommend openness we ought to show our working?
  - We could do an /auto ethnographic study/ of how to do OS data sharing initiatives
    - And publish it as a CSCW paper! :-D
    - And in the spirit of dog fooding we should pre register it.
      - These notes are the semi structured input for how we did it!

- But should we /really/ make everything accessible to everyone?
  - You don't have to push to Git...
  - Other working groups don't make everything accessible, just end product...?-
  - Could we do /Chatham house/ rules?
  - We don't want to have detailed minutes...
    - Agreed: largely pointless
  - Keeping everything may slow us down
    - We could use Github features to track tasks and issues
      - Or a big org-mode file.
        - Members of working group:
          - 2 Emacs users
          - 2 Vim users
          - 1 VS code user
  - Jo largely favours making everything open
    - But he may be in the /Qowat Milat/...
      

** TODO François to hand Git things over                          :François:
** TODO Awais to set up weekly meetings                              :Awais:
Fortnightly, til term picks up proper for next year.
** DONE Jo to stick notes in Git                                        :Jo:
** TODO Go look at dataset requirements for open source              :Awais:
** TODO Go look at OSF pre-registration requirements              :François:
** TODO Go look at artefact requirements at conferences                 :Jo:
** TODO Go look at what licenses are recommended for research       :Miquel:
** TODO Go look at funders requirements                               :Inah:

** Next time!

- We should think about building a big table aligning what is needed for Open Source and Open Research and what does what
  - And mapping it
  - And Jo should probably do it
- We should work out how to pre-register this whole experiment on OSF
