"A vase isn't here, inner is still dropped out as far as I'm aware.",
But we do have Francois and Miguel.,
So where did we get up to last time?,
We got the study information done and we came up with three hypotheses.,Catchup
We don't know what we're doing methodologically and it's non-directional.,Hypothesis

I guess we can't do blinding because...,"Reasoning,Blinding"
We are aware of the experimental manipulation.,"Reasoning,Blinding"
"Yeah, because the experimental manipulation is we're trying to do it ourselves.","Reasoning,Blinding"
is that right yeah that's correct but we don't know how it will proceed after we have,"Confusion,Reasoning"
failed this registration well I mean we don't know how it will proceed but we'll what I mean,"Confusion,Reasoning"
is what if at some point we decide then what if this can be changed after that or is this I,"Confusion,Reasoning"
don't know no this is this is fixed but I think this is the study of can we go through,
registration oh yeah yeah yeah sorry yeah,
I was thinking more on the larger scale.,Reasoning
The larger scale is a bigger thing.,
"But we also, because we have no idea what we're doing,",Confusion
we can't tell what we're getting through.,

Yeah.,
It's really hard to do that.,Frustration
There's no blinding.,Blinding
"No, so there can't be blinding because we can't blind.","Humor, Blinding"
"Well, we could still, so this is, I think, where Mikal was going.",Reasoning
"If we then, as part of the study, present the experimental setup to others and ask them to evaluate it,",Reasoning
"particularly the third hypothesis, let's say, despite not knowing what we're doing, we're still doing the right thing.",Reasoning
then we might want to blind them,"Blinding, Reasoning"
by giving them something that was prepared,Reasoning
by somebody who knows what they're doing,"Blinding, Reasoning"
versus what we end up producing.,Reasoning
But I don't think we're at the point,
where we can't even talk about that yet.,Confusion
Cool.,
Is there any additional blinding involved in the study?,"Blinding, Questioning"
No.,
What I am just thinking is,Reasoning
"if we go through the direction of no blinding,","Blinding, Reasoning"
are we limited in the type of...,Reasoning
conclusions that we will get out of this.,Reasoning
But how would we blind?,"Confusion,Blinding"

I don't think we can...,Reasoning
We're not limited more by taking that box.,Reasoning
By the way we're already running this at the end.,

Yeah.,

It's fine.,Frustration
You must select a value.,

it's fine,Frustration
we're starting the registration,

I won't look at it other than to check,"Frustration,Humor,Confusion"
that it hasn't gone mad,"Frustration,Humor,Confusion"
yeah,
yeah that's fine,
that's the most similar answer well no actually no it's registration prior to analysis of data,Confusion
but it assumes that you have created the data I assume I assume it's linear in the sense,"Meta,Confusion"
but we will by the time we register we will have created the date we will have created some of,"Meta,Confusion"
the data we won't have analyzed it but we won't have analyzed it but it will be created by then,"Meta,Confusion"
yeah it's just we're filling in the form as we create the data which is okay well let's do we'll,Confidence

doing this process.,
Right?,
Okay.,
I'm going on the bus this morning. It was just awful.,
We will require a coding scheme for categorical variables.,Reasoning
is they're not our coding scheme will emerge from our analysis of the data.,Reasoning

Okay.,
Which is how much we know what we're doing.,
So is that measured or manipulated?,
I think it's measured.,
"Measured and manipulated, because as we go, we have so increased it.",
But that's fine.,
"Right, so you mentioned that.",
you would be comfortable doing that in a non-metta study.,
"I would not, for example. I really have absolutely no clue what we're doing.",
So do we want to... But we are not measuring it and we kind of started without measuring it.,
How would we measure it other than self-reported?,
"Yeah, self-reported, I guess. Okay.",
"Like, you have a measure, which is I would know what I was doing if it wasn't so netter.",
"I've got another metric, which is I have absolutely, like, I would not be able to do this, even in a non-metter.",
So I don't understand what you mean because you have been through the process and you didn't find any barriers not doing the process.,
I absolutely have no clue.,
Just be aware we're recording in here.,
"So that's fine if you want to come through, but just be aware.",
I'm recording audio.,
"So, as you know, I do have a plan to do a study with human beings, which is very unusual, where I'm collecting data, which is also very unusual.",
"And going through this now, I find it hard, and it is not helping me going through it for that.",
I still won't know how I would do this.,
for that study.,
You are seeing the type of questions,
that you may need to consider later.,
"Yeah, but it's still not telling me,",
it's still not telling me how I would do this.,
I would still have no clue,
what I'm meant to do with those questions.,
"I can think around them,",
but I don't know that the answers I'm giving,
are the ones that are expected,
for that kind of that kind of task.,
"So in that sense,",
"I think I know less than,",
"than what Joe does. Yeah, but what I'm doing. Whereas I don't understand these quantitative",
"measures really that well, at least vaguely get, I get the method for, you know, Quol. I don't",
"really get quant, but that's just my own thing. And you presumably get that quite well. In my case,",
"the things that I never went through this process, but I have run studies on data analysis and",
collected participants information and went through similar processes of collecting this type of,
"information and analyzing, running statistical analysis on the methods that I apply in that data.",
"Then it's not like I am familiar with this particular case, but I am familiarized with the collection of data and all of this.",
But not with this process.,
Yeah.,
"So, okay.",
"So I guess then the question, if we did want to collect this stuff and let's collect it here and now, since we are collecting it here and now,",
"if we put this on a, say, a five point lichord scale, where five represents, I am extremely confident that I know what we're doing in this process,",
"and one represents, I have no confidence in what I'm doing.",
"So I think, yeah, so I understand the questions.",
I don't know what answers are expected.,
Yes.,
Was it the worst possible point of confusion?,
"So, I mean, in a weird way, I think I'd probably say, I understand the questions.",
"I know what makes sense to me as answers, but I have no idea whether they are what's expected either.",
"and equally, whereas you may say, well, I'm about a one and this, I'd say I'm probably about a four on this.",
Right. I understand the questions. I understand what it's asking and why it's asking them.,
"I just have no idea whether I'm answering them in a useful way, which I think is possibly why there's humour,",
"or at least bad academic attempt at it, sneaking into this stuff, because when it's so hard to work out what you're actually talking about, it's...",
"what about you? Where do you think you'd be on that, like at scale?",
"Yeah, I'm in the lower scale, but I wouldn't say one, maybe. But even if I am not familiar with this process, I may say two. But anyway, I agree with you that I don't know what is the expected type of answers. And maybe that's actually a really good point on, well, it takes the short example.",
I'm not sure if I have seen that everywhere else.,
"Yeah, show example.",
"It shows, it probably has examples of what you should expect to write in, I'm not sure if in all of the fields.",
"I mean, it goes back to the old API design guidance, right?",
You always expect show examples as being a good way to explain what it is that you're doing.,
And for that there are no examples here.,
It doesn't make it exactly.,
But there are.,
"Yeah, that's what I see.",
"Well, there are, aren't there?",
We've been ignoring.,
But did they miss that everywhere else?,
"Yeah, yeah, it's open in the previous box.",
There's a show example.,
"Yeah, yeah, I see it here.",
I don't know if in the previous one.,
"Yeah, yeah, all of them have it.",
This is wonderful.,
Look at that.,
We're discovering stuff.,
"Okay, that's, that's really useful.",
Okay.,
I need to an example.,
"No, but it tells you exactly what you need to.",
"So, okay, so if we go for the measured variable one,",
"single-asker will be the perceived taste and spruly. No, so we're measuring",
our confidence in the pre-registration process.,
"on a 1 to 5, oh sorry, wrong dash.",
"Like it, that I can type the N-Dash on a Mac keyboard,",
so something about me that is deeply uncomfortable.,
"5 scale, where 1 is I have no confidence.",
Yes.,
"Yeah, I will in a sec.",
And,
5 is,
I am overconfident?,
"No, um, utterly confident.",

"You mean syntax, Sarah?",

We are measuring our process of completing this paperwork?,
Are we really measured?,
We are measuring the process.,
I don't know what measure we're using.,
"Yes, it will be the analysis, what do you mean?",
And the...,
Yes.,
"This is the point, right? This is pre-registering the analysis only.",
So we will be measuring some form of the process itself.,
We are measuring the process of collecting the data of filling in.,

Which will we analyse for themes once analysed?,

And so that last sentence turns into the success of the pre-registration itself.,
We are measuring the success or not of being able to pre-register as the son as a...,
as a Boolean.,
"No, come on, we're computer scientists. Let's make one.",
It's specified before.,
"This is a bullion. It's true or false, right?",
"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, right.",
Let's offer some measures to the electrical engineers in the building with a voltage under.,
0.3 volts signifying...,
"No, hang on, I'm being trolley.",
"Yeah, yeah, it's not the other one, yeah, right.",
"So, or an average voltage of above 0.7, and anything in between will be...",
"...and define, and...",
...unsteady.,
"Hope that you've got error connection, ma'am.",
Oh.,
Why are we doing this?,
"Let's proceed. We are already... We are... No, we need to go back to the design.",
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's the almost.",
"In 14 minutes, I think we can do it today.",
"Hang on, let's have a quick look at the metadata. Oh, no.",
So design plan is the sort of thing we need to do.,
"Show example. We like the show example, but...",
"Oh, it's much shorter than I thought they were hoping.",
"they were hoping. Okay, so then we can answer this easy. It's the great sentence that Evese keeps saying to us",
that we don't really understand. Autofnographic observational study of the pre-registration process.,
I wouldn't believe this example fulfills the... What is asking?,
"No, but it's asking, it's asking it. It would really have.",
"high level, what is the method that you're applying?",
"Well, to be as detailed as is necessary given the specific priority design, well, I mean, it looks complex.",
"No, it's between subjects, right?",
"So you've got two groups, with one factor.",
One factor will be given large sugar by maths and four levels.,
One group is going to be given none.,
"One group is going to be given one gram, one group's going to be given 10 grand, one group is going",
"to give them 100 grams, and they're going to do a direct comparison between the groups.",
It tells you absolutely everything you need to know.,
Yeah.,
Except explain how the groups are going to be selected.,
"Yeah, for example.",
Randomized logs.,
"Well, it'll be the ones you get the one ground, ten ground.",
"Yeah, but it's specified randomized logs, repeated measures.",
Of the study designers attempting to pre-register the study and design.,
open science guidelines. Did we mention open science guidelines in any part of this?,
"Yeah, we did in the study information.",
But you can I forgot already what we are doing. That's that was two in the study information.,
"Yeah, we're doing an author of an order of attempt to do open science, let's do an auto-ethnographic study trying to do open science.",
And designing guidelines. In order to attempt to do to write guidelines for open science. I think that was the...,
"No, no, in the first part, in order to attempt to write guidelines to do open science.",
Oh!,
Right.,
"Guidelines to do open science, let's do an author.",
"Yeah, okay.",
I think it's worth saying to evase as the only person.,
"a vase is the only person who has a vague idea of what we actually are meant to be of doing,",
"that he really needs to turn up next week, or in two weeks time, that's bit he's not going to turn up.",
And what is the missing step here for the registration? Should we just inform our ways?,
"Right. It's right. And no, no, because I want to talk to a thing later.",
Should we ask a ways if he wants to take a look before we submit the presentation?,
"No, because I want him, because we should be recording him having a look at it",
and his comments that come back because that's part of the study.,
So he should be in here being recorded.,
It's not enough if he'd ask him to recall himself reacting to the...,
to the...,
"Yeah, and that's fine for me.",
I would just...,
You know what?,
Evace was the one who insisted that we do it like this.,
I kind of don't care that it's pets.,
"If he has to wait another week, I'd rather we did it like that",
"than we did it in person, but he's the one who wanted us to do it like this.",
Yeah.,
He should be here to do it.,
Yeah.,
"Otherwise, what's the point?",
Yeah.,
I'm learning.,
"Yeah, we're all learning.",
we could have done it a lot more cheaply by actually having,
"something worse, sorry?",
"Well, no, but I think, and like in fairness to it all,",
"I think actually the process, I think it is actually interesting",
"looking at how people do it and where they struggle, right?",
"And it will be, and it will make an interesting paper.",
"I think even just the fact that we now noticed to show example,",
It's so insane.,
"On a giant, what, enormous monitor of death,",
it took us two weeks to notice the show.,
"And even then, when we look at it, we got picky about it.",
It wasn't really helpful.,
"Well, that was kind of funny, right?",
"You aren't familiar with this, and you were like,",
"oh, this is completely unhelpful.",
"But I kind of went, no, this is helpful",
because that tells me exactly what you're expecting,
"in terms of it's a one-line answer,",
"is very succinct, what is the method?",
I think I'm happy to call it a day here before I turn inward on myself and die.,
"Yeah, and we tell a ways that he's expected in two weeks.",
Yeah.,
Do you want me to do that?,
"No, I am benevolent dictator.",
I will go shout at the prof.,
He's well used to me shouting at him.,
"I am grumpy and he can bat off me and if he does I will go and tell Roosa, who is the person who is doing this, that one of our members isn't taking part and isn't being a productive member of society.",
Which I believe is the correct process of following for doing this and is a reasonable way of doing it.,
I'm going to cut recording now.,
