So my project, so that seems about right. Let's create a new project. Okay, what are we gonna call this project?",
"Ooh data, uh what are we gonna call it? Making open science open, that works, we can always change it later. Uh",

It turns out you should really have planned this stuff a little bit better. Um okay, so pre-us registration, you'll be asked a series of questions to ensure that your sampling design analysis plans are solidified prior to beginning your study. Open-ended registration, you'll be asked to provide a narrative summary of what's contained in your project. There is no minimum character length. [SPEAKER_TURN]",reading
