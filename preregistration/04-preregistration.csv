"Right, are we recording?"
"I hope we're recording."
"If not, HTML cables, USBC, Apple TVs and screen sharing is generally speaking held to be unusable as is accessing the OSF website on someone else's computer."
"Okay, so is it actually audio recording?"
"It is audio recording."
"Okay, so I struggle to, I've still, I simply can't find this on my registrations anymore and I don't know what happened to it."
"Okay, because previously I could, when you had to do it."
"You know, I'm sorry."
"Sometimes."
"So I never could and I think maybe the way you got to it that time is to a link in the email."
"So if you have the URL, you can get to it, but it doesn't appear in your registration."
"I think that must be it."
"So hang on, let's try it ourselves then."
"Let's try and go in through OSF.io."
"Right."
"And I will go in the link."
"Dun dun dun dun da-dun-dun."
"Contributors Hallet."
"That's our dashboard."
"Here it is here it is."
"So you can see it."
"I can see it."
"I just can't."
"Contributors."
"It says you can access this draft by going to my registration."
"Well, look, none of you are listed as contributors anymore, and we definitely added you."
"But no, look, I can see it here."
"And I can go and review it, and I can edit it."
"Well, don't you edit it, because I won't be able to edit it."
"No, I understand that, but my question is that, and I can see you, Frasua, Miguel, and myself as the contributors."
"Okay."
"So I think we can establish that that registrations are not particularly usable and are best, some kind of, you know, mystic art that you can follow."
"But this is quite frustrating, isn't it?"
"Because you're trying to do open science."
"Well, I think there's also here a slight effect of we are three argumentative academics on a Friday afternoon, and we can make anything into a pig zero of a job, right?"
"No."
"Yes."
"But how do you log into your... account you should be able to see your registrations."
"It says you should be able to see it under my registrations."
"I cannot."
"But when I click on that link that came in the pre-registration, the registration draft email, I can access it and I can see you all."
"I mean it's all a lot of syllables, isn't it?"
"Okay, anyway, let's do some work now that we've found the registration, right?"
"Okay."
"Right."
"Is this saying, is this actually what we want to submit, and if it is what we want to submit, then I can take it away and do some actual work doing thematic analysis."
"Okay."
"So observational..."
"Miguel isn't here, but Avais and Francois are."
"Okay."
"So observational study, yes?"
"Yeah."
"Okay."
"We're not doing any blinding because we're not blind."
"Our study design is auto-ethnographic observational study of the process of the study designers attempting to pre-register the study and design open science guidelines."
"This is an auto-ethnographic study of the process."
"And the challenges when conducting open science, particularly within the field of computer science, this includes the experiences of designing the study conducted the research, collection of data, as well as mechanisms such as pre-registration, production of artefacts, public release of artefacts, and assessing no space their..."
"I have many times."
"Ooh!"
"The underlinees came up."
"And assessing their usefulness for reproducibility, I don't care if I spell it auto-ethnographic wrong."
"Are we happy with that?"
"Yeah."
"Good."
"Are we going to attach any files?"
"Absolutely not."
"We are not randomizing ourselves."
"We are already too confused."
"That sounds about..."
"I wouldn't put the way in an already too confused part."
"Because this is a pre-registration."
"It's a scientific registration."
"I appreciate the joke, but, you know..."
"Okay."
"Now the question is, will it save?"
"It is saved."
"That's what it says."
"A few seconds?"
"No, it didn't."
"It said."
"It said... it said did not save."
"I've got the recordings."
"We can check this."
"Oh yeah."
"Okay."
"The Jeproppinger could not auto save because for no reason."
"Okay."
"Oh no you are like yeah."
"Okay."
"Go on then."
"Sampling plan."
"We're doing registration prior to the analysis of the data because part of the data is us registering."
"So we can't have analyzed it by the time we've registered."
"We are doing screen and audio recording and transcriptions and meeting minutes of us attempting to follow open science processes and guidelines for which we are not familiar."
"We cannot be aware of patterns of summary statistics in the data as we are collecting the data as the study is inductive."
"Is inductive?"
"As the study?"
"Yes."
"Yeah."
"I don't understand that sentence as we're collecting the data as maybe there's a common missing between data and as."
"We cannot be aware of patterns or summary statistics in the data. as we are collecting the study as the as we are collecting the data as the study is ongoing."
"Ongoing?"
"Yeah, because the analysis is inductive, the study is inductive."
"The analysis is inductive, so we can add a sort of afraid after that that the analysis is inductive."
"Yeah, I'm just going to..."
"Where are you going?"
"We will remove the in and they start out of that line."
"Can we set patterns of teams would arise exactly?"
"What's the data is advised?"
"We can."
"I wouldn't say happy, but I wouldn't say happy, but you know, we just have to accept that in these times."
"Data collection procedures."
"Screen and audio recording and fortnightly meetings of the study organizers who are organising the study."
"Recreement is limited to those who are running the study as it is all through ethnographic."
"I mean, it's fine other than the..."
"A very technical, topological nature of the whole thing."
"Well, I mean, yeah."
"Do you want to say of researchers who are conducting this study?"
"Yeah, I suppose..."
"We're not organizing the study."
"We are conducting this study."
"I'd say we're probably not. not organised enough to be organizers."
"We meet, recent employees, organised."
"We've got the meeting in calendars."
"I've got a lot of things in Gallauders."
"It doesn't necessarily mean anything."
"We're not conducting the study because we don't organise."
"Because we can organize the study you get someone else to put an employee auto-ethylographic."
"We do like auto-ethnographic."
"It is a very good, long word."
"Okay, happy."
"What manipulated variables do we have?"
"This is an observational study."
"We are not manipulating anything beyond what we observe ourselves doing."
"Possibly the occasional joke."
"Measured variables."
"There are no measured variables."
"There are no measured variable. as this is a qualitative study and the results will merge inductively from analysis of the data."
"We're observing the challenges, not challengers."
"What's that old sci-fi thing?"
"Earth search, where Challenger 1, Challenger 2, spaceships involving things, anyway, this is an aside, encountered when conducting open science as well as positive experiences."
"We are also studying whether our usual less formalized process leads to similarly outcomes."
"Are we also looking at the negative experiences?"
"Well, we have the challenges."
"Fine, fine, fine."
"So can I ask a question?"
"I mean, so, you know, I mean, this is part of study."
"And this meeting is part of study."
"So we sort of highlighted quite a lot of challenges around, for example, just the frustrations with the workflow within OSF, the fact actually there was an action on me last time to go and look if there were alternative templates that we could have used and suddenly I didn't find any that doesn't mean that there are but I didn't find any of the standard templates suitable to what we were trying to do so so we've sort of in these meetings we've discussed quite a lot of what the challenges are is there positive stuff because if you don't capture it then none of that is ever going to so I think I've already captured like we said a couple of things where during like along the way where as somebody who's typically not doing pre-registration things, I'm learning a lot about the kind of things when we need to think about if there was a standard hypothesis, experiment design, experiment execution thing, loop."
"And certainly this is..."
"We are recording, so I wouldn't say anything."
"So this is something that I would..."
"I would say it."
"I'd..."
"I'd..."
"I'd..."
"I'd And this is something I'm quite happy to learn because I'm intending to move more to that direction."
"So in the context of that, if I directly, without doing this, if I'd gone, who, I'm interested in understanding what cryptographers think about this, I would have just designed an experiment and gone for it without really thinking about the peer registration."
"And now, even though I understand it's not at all appropriate for auto-ethnographic stuff, I kind of see how I could go. go about designing it for, like writing it for the thing I have in mind."
"But before Joseph comes in, I also wanted to add that I actually think that despite that the template is unsuitful, really, it still makes you think about particular things that you should be considering as part of your study."
"So I think that's quite positive."
"And ultimately, we have to work out whether this is going to provide, I guess we don't have to work out."
"We just, is this actually going to provide benefit to us?"
"And we're only going to find that out once we've done it."
"And we're only going to find that out."
"And we've done it."
"And, at the end of the study whether we find that they've got a benefit out of pre-registering our attempt to pre-register a study and so if then we find oh actually yes pre-registering and saying what we're going to do beforehand we got something useful out of it then I do wonder whether we are going to find anything useful beyond we didn't because I mean the whole point of this process is to prevent you retroferect fitting a conclusion onto your results, right?"
"At least partially."
"But we didn't have attempt to do that."
"I mean any more than thematic analysis does that anyway just by the fact that you're always looking at things from your own agendas."
"So I mean is thematic analysis even appropriate for this as a method?"
"Because we're not, we're not, because we're never going to have our conclusion. from this not be influenced by our own background and experience."
"So attempting to say, well, we're not going to be influenced by anything and this is what we're going to do, is just saying, well, we are going to be influenced."
"No, but you're not doing grounded theory."
"You're not doing, you know, Glazer's grounded tea."
"You're doing thematic analysis."
"Yeah."
"Nowhere says that you can't be influenced by your own views."
"No."
"So, well, in fact, it explicitly states that you have to acknowledge that."
"Yeah, you have to acknowledge that."
"I think, sort of, for me, what's also quite interesting is that, that part of this learning is exactly the kind of guidance that we can provide to other people."
"So our sort of conclusion could be that actually there needs to perhaps a more simpler process of registration for qualitative studies."
"Yeah."
"And I was also thinking as a positive thing that maybe there is a way of making pre-registration useful for more mathematical science projects where you're saying, I'm setting about proving this."
"You don't know if you'll succeed or not, but at the end you have a proof or you don't, right?"
"And typically there is value in also documenting the failures to do that, the fact that you attempted it in a particular way and that it didn't work is also valuable."
"And there's currently no incentives and no mechanisms to register that in any way."
"I mean, I can see something, I mean, God help us, you don't want any more wizards."
"We've got quite enough wizards as it already is."
"But you can imagine something on creating a new Jupiter notebook to say, well, what are you going to try and do here?"
"What are you going to try and analyze?"
"Do all these things here."
"And then have some authentication check to say, did you actually change that after you came to it, right?"
"Which is doing much the same thing, just as a part of the basic step."
"Because most of this stuff is fairly formulaic."
"You're saying, what are you going to do?"
"Where are you going to get your data from?"
"How are you going to analyze it?"
"What variables are you going to alter?"
"And okay, when you start an experiment at the very early stages, I mean, again, Quoll tends to be a little bit more figuring it out as you go along than that pure science quant."
"But even there, right, we know roughly what we're going to do."
"Just having those prompts early on having them formulae as part of, hey, look, you're creating a new science project."
"Okay."
"Are you happy to move on?"
"Oh, God, yes."
"No, but I think this was good to affect you because my concern is that any positives we may not be articulating in these because there is a tendency always tends to be to say what the issue is, not what the positive is, and then that biases our data by default because we are generating the data ourselves."
"Well, and again, right, because we are argumentative academics, I mean it's only partially a joke, right, but we will argue and find fault with everything."
"We are always going to have that bias in everything we do, because that's our job, right?"
"We find we poke holes in things."
"Nothing is ever going to be good enough."
"Right."
"And that's why Johnny can't encrypt."
"Right, an analysis plan."
"Are we going to use any statistical models?"
"Nope, but I am using the Whisper models to transcribe the audio, but I'm doing it locally."
"Okay, so do you want to put that, that we will be doing it locally in that?"
"I do."
"I say through whisper.cp."
"Oh, okay."
"Okay."
"Sorry, with that."
"That's fine."
"It also might be Mac Whisper, but I believe that calls that thing again."
"Because again, I don't let it run off and I just let the CPU get hot for a week."
"Are we doing any transformations?"
"No."
"Our coding scheme would emerge from the analysis of the data as per thematic analysis."
"So one thing about the thematic analysis, you will be doing that on your own?"
"I will do a first part of it on my own."
"But then..."
"I don't know how that's typically done, but would it be a manipulation from the standard method and standard results if you then get input from this as well?"
"No."
"Many ways to do it."
"So, in most social sciences, researchers will just do it individually."
"In our area, you always calculate some kind of inter-rater reliability."
"But again..."
"I'm unhappy, we're not going to be calculating interrater reliability."
"No, we don't..."
"I went to read Braun and Clark."
"Yeah."
"No, and I would say that that's again, you know, so but the key thing is that someone has to review the thematic analysis."
"Yeah, which we will do sitting down here and going, I think we had these themes behind it once I've done a first part of it."
"And then we'll say, okay, do we have a look at it?"
"Someone else will have a look at it."
"And so, well, I think there's these themes here."
"We will have a discussion about it."
"We will have an argument."
"And once we've gone through a few cycles of having an argument and we've all lost the will to argue anymore, we will say that must be what we definitively. found and we'll organise it into stories."
"Because the data here isn't so large that you can't do that as a collective exercise, but also because it is and other ethnographic experience."
"It's, so I think the right thing here would be for us to reach consensus on what the themes are rather than do the kind of classical inter-territor reliability."
"Yeah, yeah."
"Also, I mean, we shouldn't be doing inter-aithing reliability."
"It's wrong."
"Oh, no, no, I know."
"There's all sorts of criticisms of it."
"I'm not saying, I'm simply explaining to Francois what happens."
"Yeah, no."
"I mean, interrelated reliability would work if we're all going to have the same backgrounds, but as we don't all have the same backgrounds, I guess probably me and a vase are fairly similar on the grounds that he taught me most of this rubbish, or at least made me learn enough how to do it."
"Probably I'll be learning from you guys, so I'll be aligned."
"So there should at least be a bit, but we should at least have similar things, whether that would be enough to say that we would have the same experiences, probably not in a meaningful way, and then we're just calculating a statistic for the sake of argument, and it's just..."
"No, it's fine."
"I don't think that it's critical."
"No."
"Are we going to make any inferences?"
"No."
"I think we just say not applicable as this is a qualitative study, but no, it's pretty good."
"Are we going to exclude any data?"
"I mean, I know it's a qualitative study and the question there is about P values and so on, but ultimately isn't drawing relationships between themes making inferences over them?"
"It's not in the sense that it's written on there, but..."
"If we are retrofitting this into there, because normally, you would draw relationships between themes based on looking at what you find and yes it comes from the data but you are making an inference you aren't I really don't want to get into clever buggers with dictionaries it is an inference because we are saying this summarizes the themes and the kind of intense behind ourselves when we're I mean I mean, I guess it comes down to what exactly are we going to be coding for."
"I mean, I would say, okay, when I usually do it, I think of it as synthesis, more of a synthetic analysis across what has been done, not just descriptive as the themes emerge, but synthetic analysis across the themes."
"But to do that, you have to interpret stuff across, right?"
"I'm not sure you can say it's a synthetic analysis, because that implies it's grounded in some, more broad truth other than this is what seemed to happen and this is how I interpret it."
"But that's an inference, I suppose."
"It's sort of an inference, right?"
"The inference is exactly the gap between the data and the claim you make about it."
"Okay."
"So I think you can say something about it."
"Okay, well, let's say something about."
"This is about the criteria that you'll be using to make inferences."
"So I think here the criteria are your own lived experiences, right?"
"inferences will be made on the data by assigning themes to what?"
"To what though."
"To what though?"
"A."
"A."
"A."
"A."
"A. aspects of the transcript based on the stop, end of sentence."
"These themes will be inferences about our frustrations and issues."
"And issues based on our lived experience of attempting to pre-register the study."
"And it's so positive experiences."
"Not frustrations, and issues on."
"Frustrations."
"Thoughts."
"And... and what we liked."
"These will be agreed after initial coding by consensus."
"Is that enough?"
"Because we're saying here, we're not, we get the peer value thing, that we're not calculating it and checking whether it's the, we're just going to say, have we stopped arguing?"
"Yeah, I agree."
"And that's probably fine."
"I like that."
"Very nice?"
"No, it's not."
"It's wordy and horrible, but I can't be bothered."
"Data exclusion."
"Well, I mean, even qualitative studies, you do exclude data if it's of poor quality or not relevant."
"Okay, poor quality or irrelevant data."
"Or."
"So for example, all of Joseph's jokes will be discarded."
"Oh, I'm having an entire code for..."
"No, but that's what I'm saying."
"It needs to be excluded."
"It's going to become an entire theme and thing."
"Yeah, it will be."
"Research is taking..."
"There'll be a relation of... of joke per minute versus level of frustration."
"Yeah, but actually there is an interesting point, because also that is a shared experience of doing this, right?"
"So finding a way through via humor."
"Yeah."
"Because otherwise, you know, if you're sitting on your own and trying to get through this form."
"Oh, I saw this wonderful study in, it was in the journal of Annals of Improbable Research, right, where these researchers have come up with, how morbid are people, right?"
"right you know how much likely are they to linger on a picture of a corpse or something and look at these things I really wanted to try running this with computer scientists and just see whether security people are more morbid than the graphics or the programming algorithms where the C programmers are just that little bit more grisly and horrible than the RUSP programs because they've got type safety it'll be a lovely it'll be a lovely student project we should suggest I should suggest it if there's still time."
"Good luck with ethics."
"No, it would be fine because you're..."
"This was sent to me."
"Just, this is nothing to do with this."
"But someone sent this to me on the basis that I like GDPed."
"And that will be excluded."
"But I think it needs to be included so it can be excluded."
"You need to send this to Joe."
"Yeah, and we need to bring it up under our screen so that we can exclude it."
"Frankly, that you're looking at that sort of filth of race is disgusting to me."
"But, oh, well."
"Be DUP runs the world."
"It'd be nice to BGP."
"Anyway, sorry, read that."
"So, do you know Michael Lucas did his..."
"You know Michael Lucas, technical author?"
"He writes really good technical books about how to configure SSAH, Thudeau."
"He wrote a book about mastering Ed, which Ken Thompson said, finally, someone was giving Ed the attention. it deserves."
"He did a version of how to configure a simple network management protocol, right?"
"And he did regular version of it, which is people."
"He also did a special edition of it, which is called the Networkonomicon, which is just covered in HB Lovecraft art."
"I've got a copy of it."
"It's silly."
"But all this is going to get excluded."
"Oh, no."
"Just so that this is irrelevant data."
"We've just generated irrelevant data."
"We've just generated irrelevant data, and now we'll be able to have a code for marking the irrelevant data. is relevant, thus showing that we went through the processes of excluding data."
"It's the danger of meta studies."
"It's all..."
"How will you deal with missing or incomplete data?"
"Well, no, because if we're going to say poor quality or irrelevant data will be excluded, if we're talking about poor quality, then it may be our arguments here which are missing because this isn't going to be recording sound."
"So we are going to deal with it by ignoring it, I would imagine."
"Does that make sense?"
"No, but I don't think that there is any incomplete data, because what is incomplete here?"
"I think it is a qualitative auto-ethnographic study."
"There is no missing data."
"Why did it want me to rewrite it with an AI?"
"Oh, horrible."
"Are we doing any exploratory data?"
"Well, this is entirely exploratory."
"So that's fine."
"Yeah."
"Okay."
"Well, we have 15 minutes left."
"Oh, God, thank you."
"Is there any other information?"
"No, good."
"You can come through but we are recording, so don't say anything you will go on the recording."
"Okay?"
"Metadata."
"Oh, there we go."
"There we go."
"Gosh, what's wrong with the screen?"
"What goes wrong with it when you try to..."
"I think it doesn't update fast."
"Oh, I think it's because it's going on the projector."
"What you're saying is, I really need a new laptop."
"Have you got a grant which could fun for it?"
"I can't even get a laptop for myself."
"No, but you could do this one."
"It's newer than mine."
"Don't tell them that."
"Okay."
"No, no, no, no, no, no."
"What happened?"
"We don't know what we are doing."
"We changed that last time."
"Yeah, we did, didn't we?"
"Yeah."
"Why did it say that?"
"Why is it not changed?"
"It's in the hypothesis."
"More importantly, why didn't it let us change it when we went through it?"
"Because you started from design plan."
"Oh."
"Okay, that all looks fine still."
"Did we not remove the..."
"No, I think we had..."
"Sorry, when I was redoing this, I tried to remember what we did, and I think we came to the conclusion that we couldn't because it was part of their subfield."
"Yes."
"Yeah, yeah, I remember that."
"Yeah, so we changed this last time."
"Yes, but whether I transcribed it all, because I just took Mikkel's note, so it looks like I haven't just crossed out the early of it."
"Okay."
"So let's just delete it there."
"Oh, no."
"No?"
"So I think the first one was removed."
"Yeah."
"Because we did contest."
"Well, I think we replaced them with these."
"Oh, God, I hate this box."
"I didn't do explicit hypothesis."
"So I think we just delete that. that's enough isn't it yeah i think we frame them exactly as the hypothesis from what you're okay and now we're back so if you can go to review so are you going to do."
"So are you going to register it or going to wait for we have a look?"
"I am done."
"Oh no you've done."
"Oh no you've done it."
"Oh!"
"Do you know?"
"Do you not?"
"Do you not?"
"Do you know any files and then stop me from editing a file you've got a computer so um you want to enter registration into embargo right until we are done with the study no do we care I mean given that your GitHub repo is open doesn't really matter does it no okay I'm okay I mean there is nothing in there that we wouldn't say publicly anyway no we'll be on the internet archive."
"Yeah."
"That was brilliant."
"You know, I always wanted to be cancelled for something."
"Oh, pending."
"We're pending."
"Unfortunately, I have pending box means I can't see what the actual text box says."
"All of us need to confirm that we're happy with it."
"Yeah."
"Well, that's good."
"Yeah, I've got her message."
"No."
"New feature."
"You can add funder information."
"Well I can't because I promise not I wouldn't edit it."
"Yeah but nobody's funding this."
"Well no."
"No one's funding it."
"Well, someone is funding it, right?"
"They're paying for a time."
"Yeah."
"You know, there's no actual time allocated to it."
"So they're not paying for it."
"Well, technically, we're all being paid for our time, right?"
"Technically we have a job."
"This is a role that is not accounted. for you know, load."
"Anyway, I think we're done."
"I'm going to stop recording."
"No, hang on, don't stop recording."
"So how do I approve this thing now?"
"So it says approve it, but how do I approve it?"
"Do we need a separate section, a separate section for you to, a session for you to have a go and try and have you figured out where to approve it?"
"No."
"Stop making fun of."
"But also I'm trying to do it on my phones."
"That's not ideal."
"But show me, Joseph, where do I approve it?"
"But so you have a my registration button which is..."
"No, no, but it says..."
"OSF registries, that's where I need to go."
"Yeah, but I went there before."
"So somewhere I should be able to say, I approve this."
"And I can't."
"Submitted."
"So if you go in my registration..."
"We should be recording the surveys."
"No, are you recording it?"
"I'm recording it on my screen, but I'm not recording your screen because your screen is different from my screen."
"Okay."
"Okay."
"It's a concept of ownership."
"Okay."
"It's permitted and now there's pending registration approval."
"Yeah."
"I know."
"And then there's a view."
"Yeah, but that's where I was before."
"So."
"But it now says that I have to approve it, but I have no way of approving it."
"Indeed."
"I mean, there should be a thing that says I approve this thing."
"Is it you who need to?"
"to approve it or is it them you need to approve it?"
"It's us."
"It's from the contributors."
"It's from its contributors."
"What did it?"
"So..."
"Yeah, and it came to this email."
"It said, approve this thing."
"How interesting."
"Sorry, so what?"
"What?"
"I can fork this."
"I can fork this, I can bookmark it, I can share it, I can look at all the, it says it's awaiting approval."
"Can you like and subscribe to updates?"
"I can't do anything to it."
"Even if you do it for a bit, I won't save it."
"But Joseph, is it because you're still logged in?"
"If you log out of it, if you log out."
"Because I'm logged in now."
"Yeah, but I think this doesn't."
"How do I log out?"
"I'm going to go to this blue button because that looks like a sort of thing."
"Yes, the blue button will do you log out?"
"Lock out?"
"I could donate."
"Absolutely not."
"No one's funding this."
"Have I logged out now?"
"Okay."
"So if I..."
"There is a better way to manage your research."
