## Environment preparation

Some parts of the repository use Python3.10 and some package dependecies. We suggest to create a virtual environment and install the dependencies with pip

```
python3.10 -m venv venv
```

Load the environment

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

update pip

```
pip install --upgrade pip
```

and install the dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
