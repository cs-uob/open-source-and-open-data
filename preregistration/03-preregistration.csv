"Hello, Bossface.",
Hello.,
"How are you?",
"I'm all right.",
"Why am I consenting to being recorded and transcribed, Joseph?",
"Because you are.",
"Because that was part of our agreements for how we would do this.",
"Well, of course, because this is our auto-ethnography.",
"It is, isn't it?",
"So are you going to start by receiving informed consent from everyone?",
"No, we decided that we wouldn't bother with that.",
No.,
"On the grounds that we'd set it up for ourselves to go and say, yes, we should be doing this.",
"And then we'd all said, yes, we'll do this.",
"So therefore we already have agreed consent.",
Okay.,
"But yeah, okay.",
"But I think, you know, for due process, we should remind people that this is being video and audio recorded and the transcripts will be used for analysis.",
"And made freely available?",
Yes.,
"So, yes.",
"You can, in fact, already look on our GitHub page and find all the different insults I've called you in the previous sessions.",humor
"That may not be such a good idea, Joseph.",humor
"And yet...",humor
"Someone on the Twitterverse will get upset.",humor
"Well, it's, you know, that's what you get for. for doing self-study of these things.",
Okay.,
Right.,
"So, glorious leader.",
Yeah.,
"Well, actually, now I'm concerned, because if I say glorious leader, it gets transcribed.",
Okay.,
"Wouldn't be the worst thing we've said so far.",
"But as you can very well see, I am in the office as mandated, but you both couldn't make it in.",
"But I just felt that on principle I should come in to demonstrate my commitment.",
Okay.,
"Okay, what are we doing?",
"So, me, Francois, Miguel, have been through the form.",
"You fill in to pre-register a study.",
"Our basic conclusion, having filled it in, was that we don't know what the hell we're doing.",confusion
Okay.,
"Whilst we think we filled things in correctly, we felt that we ought to have the only other person in the whole of this silly working group who is even a vaguest idea of what this process actually is to filling in these things.",checking
Okay.,
"Go and have a look at it.",
"So I did and I, so I have done my homework.",
Great.,
Okay.,
"So I did.",
"My question to you was to what extent are you happy for me to directly edit or to what extent do you want to do this right in the meeting now?",discussion
"So we could put it up on the screen. we could discuss, I could edit it there and then.",
"There are things that I think are perfectly fine.",
"I think there are things that I don't think we need, and I think there are things that we need to potentially think about changing.",discussion
"But that's just my view.",
"So if you're doing this collectively, then we need to decide what we are happy with.",discussion
"So my view would be, so normally we're doing this on my laptop, which makes it easy for me to share screen, which is why I've had to turn on the silly recording thing.",
"My view is if you start sharing your screen, it should all be picked up by teams.",
"Let's edit it here and now.",
Okay.,
"Well, I mean, I can, I'm happy to share my screen.",
"Yeah, yeah.",
"Let me.",
"Otherwise, we're not all really doing it together, and I feel that's sort of slightly cheating.",
Okay.,
"So I trust that you can see my screen.",
"We can.",
And...,
"How are you, Francois, by the way?",
"I hear you've been horribly sick.",
"I'm okay.",
"Well, I'm sorry.",
"I didn't ask you about your illness and well-be. because I didn't want it to be transferred.",
Yes.,
Okay.,
Okay.,
"So you haven't put any affiliated institutions.",discussion
"Why not?",discussion
"I think it's because we could not.","discussion,annoyance"
"I think they're inherited from the contributors and none of us have put in our institutional affiliation to our account.","discussion,annoyance"
"Oh, okay.","discussion,annoyance"
"Mine should be there because I do have a... longstanding but maybe I never really added it so yeah okay yeah I need to fix mine as well okay well I mean I think what I can do is I can I can fix this right now which I'm doing so yeah so mine wasn't I have a few in here okay so let me see if I can then associate it Bristol School of Computer Science.","discussion,annoyance"
"And I am a...",
"Okay, but I think you guys can do this too on your profile.",
So...,
"Should I try and sign it?",
Yes.,
Okay.,
"So, let me go back to my projects. no that is oh no where have I gone now sorry all my registration sorry it has gone no this has gone into where has it gone okay I'm finding this very strange because it has seems to have lost my registrations.","discussion,frustration"
"Oh, because the registration isn't yet.",
"It's a draft, yeah.",
"It's a draft.",
"Okay, I'm going to have to, okay.",
"Here, okay, back to this.",
Okay.,
"So let me go.",
Okay.,
"Back to my registrations and see if I can, No, I still can't associate a project, an institution, which is very strange.","discussion,frustration"
"It is.",
Yes.,
"If you hit that a little arrow on the right-hand side, there's a little down triangle under affiliation.","discussion,helping"
"Oh, no, there isn't.",
"No, there isn't.","discussion,frustration"
"That's exactly the problem, right?","discussion,frustration"
Yeah.,
Okay.,
"So you chose, why did you choose the CC license?",discussion
"Because that's what we said we would do it under.",discussion
Okay.,
"I wasn't sure why is it social and behavioral sciences?",discussion
"Because we're looking at how we behave when we're filling in forms.",discussion
"So since it's qualitative, Miguel argued that it should be social and behavioral?","discussion,confusion"
"No, it's not.","discussion,assertion"
"I think we've kind of agreed.",
Okay.,
"So my view would be that this is really computer science, HCI, computer supported cooperative work.","discussion,assertion"
"I think it certainly is science and technology studies.","discussion,assertion"
"But I don't think that we are doing kind of social science. sociology research or psychology research per se, and certainly not physical sciences and mathematics or organization development.","discussion,assertion"
"So I don't know why we are being organization development and physical sciences and mathematics.","discussion,assertion,questioning"
"I think it's because it's the super, super classes of the computer sciences bit.","discussion,confusion"
"Are you sure?",
"No, sorry, the organization development is part of social and behavioral sciences.",confusion
"I think we can take it off.",assertion
"No, yeah, I think physical sciences you are right is that.",assertion
"So I think the reason why we selected those is because one of the outcomes, one of the things we want this to enable is the setting of policy within the school of CS, which was about organization development.","discussion,questioning"
"But that may be less part of the research and more part of what we'll do after the research is finished.","discussion,questioning"
"I think that is the goal.",
"I'd argue.",
"I mean, okay, this has to be a collection thing.",
"I think it's really interesting because this is part of the, you know, and I think we should discuss it.","meta,discussion"
"This is really helpful because in the end, this comes up in our analysis.","meta,discussion"
"Because I suddenly think that this is computer science.",discussion
"I suddenly think this is STS.","discussion,confusion"
Okay.,
"STS is not so.",
Yeah.,
"I don't, I can't see that we are studying really, we are not studying behavior.",discussion
"We are not studying psychology and things like that.",discussion
"So I don't think that that, so any behavioral scientists would tell us that this is not behavioral science.",discussion
Okay.,
"And if you look at the subtopics, none of that, I mean, is it really anthropology that we are doing?","discussion,questioning"
"I'm not sure.",
"Even though it's ethnography, it's not anthropology.","discussion,assertion"
"I mean, a lot of STS work does ethnography.",
"So are we comfortable if I dropped organization development and social and behavioral science out of this?",discussion
Absolutely.,
"We had a similar conversation.",discussion
"We were confused about whether we should add them or not.","discussion,confusion"
Okay.,
"But I think it's fine to remove them just like it was fine to add them as well.",discussion
"Oh, but I lost STS.",
Yeah.,
Why?,
"Because it's part of social and behavioral sciences.",discussion
Okay.,
"Then I will leave STS.","discussion "
"That makes sense.",
Okay.,
"Sorry, I thought it was only the psychology part, which was I obviously can't see this properly on my computer.","discussion,confusion"
"So I'm getting quite confused.","discussion,confusion"
Okay.,
"Welcome to our world.",confusion
Okay.,
"No, I mean, the form isn't really complicated.",easy
Okay.,
"So I think, we should I mean, is this really our, so the reason we are registering the study is to study OSF or the reason we are registering the study is that we want to study processes for open science, and a part of that is registration of the study and then a reflection on the processes for the open science framework.",meta
"Yes, that's the purpose, but that's not a hypothesis.","meta,discussion,hypothesis"
"So what is the hypothesis?","meta,discussion,hypothesis"
"Well, the ones we managed to came through with it, well, we didn't know what we were doing and that we should be able to muddle through the process despite not having done it before, essentially.","meta,discussion,hypothesis"
"I mean, that we don't know what we're doing, I think.","meta,discussion,hypothesis"
"No, but that's not the hypothesis, right?","meta,discussion,hypothesis"
"It's not testable.","discussion,hypothesis,argument"
"It kind of is testable.","discussion,hypothesis,argument"
"No, it's not.","argument,discussion,hypothesis"
"Because I manage to complete the process or we don't.","discussion,hypothesis,argument"
"If we can't complete the process, I mean, admittedly it's a bit of a silly one, because if we can't complete the process, then we won't punish to pre-register the study.","discussion,hypothesis,reasoning"
"So I think the point was the first one.",
"We don't know what we're doing is not testable because the only thing we can do is provide evidence that we've never done it before. that doesn't mean in heaven or show you know anything like this.","discussion,hypothesis,reasoning"
Yeah.,
"I would say that our hypothesis has to be that open science processes are often challenging for researchers to follow and navigate, because that is something that you can test.","discussion,hypothesis,reasoning"
Right.,
"Because even so I mean the problem here is that okay so this is a reflection now because OSF is typically designed in a way which is not very well suited to qualitative studies.","discussion,hypothesis,reasoning,criticism"
"That's my experience in the past as well.",criticism
"Because in a qualitative study which is exploratory, you don't really set out with a hypothesis.","hypothesis,criticism,methods"
"You are setting out to study a phenomenon.","hypothesis,criticism,methods"
Okay.,
"So I would suggest that actually for the for completeness, we can we can set. sort of note this in the hypothesis, that this is actually, you know, the objective is to explore open science processes and frameworks, okay, but that doesn't neatly fit in with the notion of a hypothesis in pre-registration, and the hypotheses that we particularly also want to explore here is that the open science processes can often be complex and difficult to navigate for researchers. because actually this discussion is already an example that they are.","discussion,hypothesis,reasoning,criticism,methods,qual"
Yeah.,
"What do we think?",
"Shall I write this and you can tell me if it's wrong?",
"I won't delete the previous part.",
"So this is...",
"I mean, I think that was kind of our experience of filling the rest of it in.",criticism
"It's that as soon as you try and go for something which isn't strongly numerical, the whole form process kind of fell apart of it and that, well, we don't really know what we're doing.","qual,frustration"
"And it's asking us for what are we going to be testing against?","qual,frustration"
"Well, we don't know.","qual,frustration"
"We're just going to see what emerges.","qual,frustration"
"And it's not always immediately clear.","qual,frustration"
"I mean, that's a reflection on the whole process, right?","qual,frustration"
"But whether that's just us doing something quite qualitative here or...","qual,frustration"
"I don't know.",
"Don't know.",
"For completeness, we include a hypothesis.",frustration
"We're basically just saying here that we have to put something in.",frustration
Yeah.,
"Because you're telling us we have to.",frustration
But.,
Yeah.,
"All modern processes and mechanisms are, often challenging to use and navigate for researchers.",frustration
"And then do you want to delete these bit?",
"there's still the positive aspect of they're challenging because they put structure onto something that we do anyway when we're doing good science or when we think we're doing good science I guess so so the the former hypothesis three which was about what we end up with is not too far from from what we get with I like that I like that okay Okay.",discussion
"So if we had, we include two hypotheses.","discussion,hypothesis"
Okay.,
"Two hypotheses.",
One.,
Okay.,
"And two.",
"Should we say research?",
"good research practices.",
"Propon science in an ad hoc we are not too far from best practice imposed by platforms such as well.","hypothesis,phrasing"
"Sorry, I keep noticing it pops up, keeps popping up the error message saying you're not allowed to save.",saving
"It's okay.",
Yeah.,
"Oh, I assume that at some point I'll be able to save.",saving
"It says I am not allowed to auto save.",saving
So.,
Okay.,
"Shall I try to move forward and see?",
"Yes, let's see if it saves.",
"This is maybe copy your text first.",saving
"Yeah, I have.",
Okay.,
"Let's go back.",
"Yes, it has saved.","saving,wrong"
Okay.,
Okay.,
"Uh, it is an observational study.",
"Uh, so that is absolutely fine.",
"No blinding is involved in the study.",blinding
"I thought that was absolutely fine.",
"Auto, it's, uh, ethnographic of the, so my question was that is this the registration, so this is what really I was wondering, right?","confusion,questioning"
"So I'm sorry, I wasn't there last time.",
"But is the sort of the process of registration just to study OSF or is the process of registration for the study itself?","meta,questioning"
"So it is both an object of study, but it is also part of the study, right?","meta,questioning"
"So I think we need to be very clear about that, right?","meta,questioning"
"So I think there's a question of how much do we want to get done before the head of research comes and bites a head off for not doing any work.","humor,foreshadowing"
"And if we want to have this done by September or October at the latest, I don't think we're going to get much further than studying the pre-registration process.",meta
"In which case, yeah, the pre-registration is all we're doing.","meta,questioning"
"But no, but we are running the study as we speak.",meta
"I mean, we are collecting data right now in this meeting.","meta,questioning"
"Yeah, I know.",
"So my point would be that I think if the director of research, I have to be very careful as this has been transcribed, if the director of research asks us, we should be clear that we are still exploring, right, if that is the issue.",meta
"Because in the end, we want to get good scientific insights, you know, the timescale may not work.",meta
Yeah.,
"That's fine.",
"So I would update this paragraph.",
"I would say that, you know, so, and I wanted to write sort of more detail here.",adding
"So if I write and you shout at me.",
Okay.,
"So this is an auto-ethnographic study of the processes and the challenges. When conducting open science, particularly within the field of computer science.",description
"Okay, because we are not doing something broader than that.",
Okay.,
"This includes experiences of designing the study, conducting the research collection of data as well as mechanisms such as pre-registration of artifacts, public release of artifacts, and assessing their What do you call it?",description
Reproduceability.,description
"Their reproducibility?",
Yeah.,
"No, you don't reproduce the artifacts, right?","questioning,reproduction"
"So their usefulness for reproducibility?","questioning,reproduction"
"Because you can't reproduce artifacts.","questioning,reproduction"
"You can reproduce artifacts, right?",
"No, but in this case, you can't, right?",
"Because it's primarily our meeting recordings, our data.",
"So in the end, what you want to do is that someone else comes along, and they want to do a thematic analysis on it.",reproduction
"They should be able to quite easily see how our findings teams arose, right?",reproduction
"They won't reproduce our data.",
"No, but they should if they reran the same thing, right?","process,reproduction"
"And so they ran a bunch of meetings each week trying to pre-register studies and look at how this stuff was going.","process,reproduction"
"They should come to much the same conclusions.","process,reproduction"
"Not on a qualitative study, because this is not a large sample.","qual,process,reproduction"
"I mean, they may have a better understanding of how to do pre-registration compared to only one person in the room having done it.","qual,process,reproduction"
"Okay, I can buy that.",
"That's why you were going to say something.",
"No, I think for me, the use of artifact to talk about data is a bit confusing.","confusion,artifacts"
"And again, this is me working in a field where maybe data is more of an input to the process.","process,data"
"But here, we're collecting data as part of the research.","process,data"
"So it is an artifact of the research.","process,data"
"But artifacts here would also be, for example, the thematic map that we come up with.","process,data,qual"
"So this is also the second thing that I'm not used to is that given the same data, if we give the same transcripts and videos to another team to say, hey, do a thematic analysis of that, they will end up with different results than we ended up with as well.","qual,process,reproduction"
"Typically, they wouldn't end up with entirely different results.","qual,process,reproduction"
"They may have slightly different teams.","qual,process,reproduction"
"But I would say that in this case, they might have entirely different themes because of exactly what you just said, right?","qual,process,reproduction"
"You know, our analysis of those themes is grounded in our own experiences.","qual,process,reproduction"
"And if our experiences of this of creating those themes is that only one of us has ever done this before, it doesn't generalize, right?","qual,process,reproduction"
"So the themes could be.",
"And we would expect them to be entirely different because they're based on our experiences.","qual,process"
"But what I would expect is that by looking at our data and looking at our thematic map and our document. of how we have conducted the thematic analysis, they should be able to reproduce how our themes were derived.","qual,process"
"If they independently did it, it might be different.","qual,process"
Right?,
"So it's an interesting question of how much detail we include in our artifacts in itself.","qual,process"
"It is getting into the more modern end of what are they called?",qual
"Braun and Clark, right?",qual
"It's how much are we an input to our own analysis for them?",
"And if we're saying we are an input, then we would be to generalize a tool.",
"But isn't that, I mean, from memory and, you know, I mean, that's also the kind of big debate within grounded theory, isn't it?",qual
"I mean, I think it was Glazer, who was of the view that you could be completely, you know, objective and leave back your own experiences.",qual
"But then a lot of the debate and grounded theory has been that you can't, you know, leave, leave your experiences.",qual
"So I think one of the interesting things here we should also do is as to how our experiences shape our approach.",qual
"So exactly the point that Francois was making the frame data is something that is an input.",qual
Right.,
Okay.,
"Are we happy with this for now?",
"And then I can cut out this bit.",
"Go for it.",
Okay.,
"Either way, we've got evidence that we've definitely thought about these things because we were just talking about.","meta,process"
"Oh, it ought to save something.",saving
"Okay, so registration prior to analysis of the data, because, yeah, I mean, I suppose we are already human observing.",
"Oh, by the way, one of the things that I was thinking was that some of these issues that we are finding as we are going through, now you have a screen recording of this.","saving,process"
Yeah.,
Right?,
"So we can actually also use this. this as our data set, but, I mean, for example, I wouldn't be comfortable my video being on, but I think the screen recording could be part of our data set in itself.","process,meta"
"But the other interesting thing is that, you know, if you write about it, then we can include screenshots of where we were having struggles.","process,meta"
"And I mean, even this thing about where it keeps saying, I can't ought to save","saving,process"
Yep.,
Right?,
"That said it's very, very stressful.","meta,frustration"
Okay.,
"If you look in the Git repo, you'll find recordings of all the previous sessions on the screens and there.",meta
Okay.,
"One additional note about the auto-saving, there's also that caution, but only one person is able to edit a registration draft at a time.",saving
Yes.,
"Joe, are you editing this?",
No.,
"Okay, cool.",
Okay.,
"And if it all does go to pot, I will go and re-type in what Awais typed in.","saving,foreshadowing"
"But point of order. as computer scientists, we know how to build multi-user systems, okay?","frustration,annoyance,usability"
"Yet this system only allows one person to add it at a time.","frustration,annoyance,usability"
"Look, Awais, that people don't use GIT as a long-standing disagreement.","frustration,annoyance,usability"
"No, but it's interesting, isn't it?","frustration,annoyance,usability"
"That, I mean, this is, research is collaborative, right?","frustration,annoyance,usability"
"And we can't collaboratively work on a document.","frustration,annoyance,usability"
"And there are systems that are there.","frustration,annoyance,usability"
"So I can only assume that the way the system is architected is, this is just like a session and only one person can do at a time, right?","frustration,annoyance,usability"
Okay.,
"So the only issue I had with this particular one was that it's about attempting to pre-register the study.",meta
"I would say that it's tempting to follow open science guidelines and processes, is what I was thinking, you know, follow.","meta,process"
"Do we know what those open science guidelines and processes we're trying?","meta,process"
"attempting to follow are yet?","meta,process"
"Some we do, some we don't.","meta,process"
"Some we do.",
Yeah.,
"I would say how do we know with, yeah, okay, but, okay, it's getting needlessly philosophical, I think.",meta
"No, but I think it is, you could argue that part of this is also discovery of processes and guidelines we are not aware of.","meta,process"
"Yeah, I think for me it was really, so when I saw this, this form and this is when I said, I have no clue what I'm doing, to me, this was the process and guideline was do a pre-registration and the rest will follow.",meta
"It forces you to think about what you want ahead of time.",process
"And therefore, this is what we're doing, right?","meta,process"
"To me, it's attempting to follow the process and guidelines by just doing it.","meta,process"
"I agree.",
"I disagree that the data does not exist prior to registration because some of the data does exist prior to registration.","data,preregistration"
"I think for me the main issue was that we were focusing on the registration as the object when registration is both an object but also part of the wider thing.","data,preregistration"
"I wanted to remove the bit about patterns or summary statistics because patterns and summary statistics, patterns are relevant, but summary statistics are not, right?","data,editing"
"Because it's qualitative.",
Yeah.,
"So I wanted to say as the study is inductive, and these patterns or themes will emerge once the data is analyzed.",editing
Okay.,
"Data collection procedures, okay.",
"Okay, yes, all sounded fine.",
"Sample size.","sample size"
"So it's now currently four.","sample size"
Four.,
Right.,
Yeah.,
"Now this is quite interesting.",
"We've never talked about.",
"So why did Inah drop out?",
"He skipped two meetings and felt that he couldn't contribute to it.",
Okay.,
"So do we now need someone else, or are we feeling that we are still okay?","sample size"
"He apparently wrote to the head of research to ask for someone to reassign someone else to hit, but I never heard anything else back.","sample size,process"
"And my view is if he wants to come back, he's more than welcome to. otherwise we will plow on.","sample size,process"
"Okay, so can I change?",
"I mean, because let's be honest, we would normally do this with just one person, right?","process,sample size"
"Yeah, but if we were doing this process as part of it, I mean, one and a PhD student, right?","process,meta"
"Yeah, okay, so currently four, right?",
"Okay, yes.",
"Okay, I will, when we, stopping rule, yes, when we've completed the study.","process,sample size"
"That seemed fine to me.",
"Okay, yeah, there is no manipulated variables.",
"So this is the measured variables was the one that I was uncomfortable about.","confusion,variables"
"Because, I mean, this is again designed very much for quantitative, quantitative work.","confusion,variables,qual"
"So I would personally think that there are no variables to measure.","confusion,variables,qual"
"This is an ethnographic study and the analysis is inducted.",
"So I think those were related to the hypothesis.",
"Like we actually made an effort to go back to the hypotheses and figure out what are we measuring with respect to those hypotheses and how. how are we testing them?","hypothesis,variables,confusion"
"So that first one was to measure how confident we are with the process itself, and that was to measure do we know what we're doing.","qual,variables,questioning"
"But the rest of it, I believe, suggests that something along the lines of we're not measuring variables we're doing qual.","qual,variables,questioning"
Yeah.,
"My concern is that it kind of, it binds us to do this kind of, like a scale analysis, which from a qualitative study perspective, I mean, Joseph and I would suddenly, you know, bulk at the idea of anything like that, because any one who does qualitative research will go, well, that's not an appropriate way of doing this, right?","qual,process"
"You say to the person who put it in there.","argument,process"
"Oh, sorry.",
"It's no, so I would.",
"Joseph, as part of the process, we are allowed to challenge each other, including our glorious leader.","humor,process,argument"
"Of course.",
Yes.,
"Of course, and I will make note of where the guillotine falls.",humor
"I think, absolutely.",
"So I put it in there because if it wants a variable, let's suddenly have a variable, right?","variables,process,frustration"
"I agree, likerts are not good.","frustration,qual,process"
"And the whole part of this is, well, let's see what we talk about.",
"Let's see where we understand.",
"But if you're going to have a measure of how we feel, how confident we feel in this process to begin with, let's have some value, even if it is ultimately completely meaningful.","variables,process,frustration,qual"
"So I think you know just at this you are bound to it.",process
"Sorry, go on.",
"So I think one of the things we did discuss when we were filling in this box and I'm the one who said hey, but we had this hypothesis and we're not measuring anything about it.","measuring,process,confusion"
"But already when we discussed the measure of it, it was already more multidimensional than I know what I'm doing and I'm not I don't know what I'm doing.","measuring,process,confusion"
"It was more about I know how I do open science, but I don't know what this pre-registration process is. is asking of me in the context of this particular study.","meta,measuring,process,confusion"
"And so I think it might be also that we can measure it quantitatively through actual meaningful statements about what we feel good about and what we don't feel good about, what we understand and what we don't understand.","measuring,process,confusion"
"We are a sample size of four.","process,methods,qual"
"Yeah, but again, so for quality.","process,methods,qual"
"And we are also the researchers.","process,methods,qual"
"We are not an unbiased sample.","process,methods,qual"
"So it carries no weight, I'm afraid.","process,methods,qual"
"So my concern isn't that what we measure or no, because I personally don't think we can measure.","process,methods,qual"
"But my sort of other concern is that the whole reason for pre-registration is that you clearly state what you are doing.","process,methods,qual"
"And then you don't deviate from it.","process,methods,qual"
"Or if you do deviate, then you have to provide a justification.","process,methods,qual"
Okay.,
"So my question is, why are we committing ourselves to measuring something which we already think is, not the right thing to measure potentially.","process,methods,qual"
"No, so again, we've agreed by removing it from the hypothesis that this was not the right thing.","process,methods,qual"
"Oh, okay.",
Okay.,
"So I think this this thing.",
"What are writing here then?",
"So I would put that there are so there are no measured variables as this is a qualitative study and the results will be. emerge inductively from analysis of the data.","process,data,variables,editing"
"We are measuring the challenges and what was it?",editing
"We're not measuring we are studying.",frustration
"Sorry, what were you going to say?",
Observing.,
"Oh, observing, yes, observing.",
"The challenges...",
"I love the constant auto-corrects.",frustration
"Yes, when conducting open science, as well as positive experiences, right?","sarcasm,editing"
"We are also studying whether... our usual ad hoc processes lead to similar outcomes.","process,editing"
"My question to Francois is, that's a really nice second hypothesis that you put in there.",hypothesis
"Does this mean that then we will also go back to our previous research and have a look at whether the outcomes were similar?",
"So the difficulty with doing that, as you were writing this, I realized that I literally can't do it because the processes I would follow for my usual research are completely different.","methods,frustration"
"So even if I did it open science, it's still not statistical, but it's not qualitative either.","methods,frustration,confusion"
"It's quantitative, logical, deductive rather than inductive or observational kind of science.","methods,frustration,confusion"
"And so even if I did fill in a pre-registration, it would actually be different as well.","methods,frustration,confusion"
"So my question here would be that, I mean, you can only compare qual studies, right?","questioning,methods"
"But then Joseph and I have plenty of qual studies where we can go back and look at the artifacts and see did we end up with similar outcomes.","questioning,methods"
"And I think as a reflection exercise, that could be very, very interesting.","meta,reflection"
"And what would our...",
"As a reflection exercise, I guess it, what would our reflection be that we didn't go and, you know, p-hack our results out of things?","meta,reflection"
"And, well, I mean, we know that, right?",
"We published...",
"But also the...",
"But I think it's going to be more about the overall outputs that you produced, right?",data
"So is the data that you collected... actually aligned with the hypotheses you were testing.","hypothesis,data,process"
"Did the methods that you use, did you choose appropriate method for the problem you were solving or investigating or studying or whatever?","methods,hypothesis,process"
"But so, okay, if you go to that Simon Peyton Jones thing, right?",writing
"How to write a great research paper.",writing
"The whole premise behind that thing is that you write, start writing the paper and you start writing down the methods first.","process,writing,methods"
"And then as you go along, you tweak based on what you're going, what you're going, along with the experiment.","process,writing"
"It's kind of...",
"I guess it's how I feel a bit with this... filling in these measured variable things.","frustration,variables,process"
"We're just always saying, well, we're not doing that.","frustration,process"
"It feels very much that this process isn't...","frustration,process"
"For what we're trying to do, and we're trying to...","frustration,process"
"No, I agree. ...something weird into a very formal...","frustration,process,annoyance"
"You must do this, this, this, this, and this is what we're going to do, but that's not... really a good description of how we normally do science.","frustration,process,annoyance"
"I mean, that we're being honest about.",process
"I think we're not trying to force results out.","process,methods,open"
"I disagree.",discussion
"The way Peyton Jones talks about, and that's, again, a very different kind of research anyway, the methods themselves don't change.","methods,writing,discussion"
"It's the solution to the problem.","methods,writing,discussion"
"So they still have identified the problem early on, the methods that they'll be using to evaluate whether their solution is correct or not. or is doing the right thing or useful or usable or whatever.","methods,writing,discussion"
"But then those don't change as they go through the study or through the work.","methods,writing,discussion"
"What changes is the solution.","methods,writing,discussion"
"Maybe they restrict, they add limitations to the subset of problems they look at.","methods,writing,discussion"
"But Peyton Jones never goes back and says, oh, we'll just evaluate it using completely different criteria.","methods,writing,discussion"
"Because that would be solving a different problem, right?",
"I agree with that.",
"I'm not sure I agree that you know necessarily the problem so much when you start.","methods,frustration"
"No, but in this case, that is exactly the case, right?",
"But that has to be our reflection, that the OSF process is designed for a particular type of research.","methods,frustration"
"So this is actually the roots of this, if I'm not wrong, are in actually research on behavioral science, where people would collect the data, but then alter the hypotheses based on what fitted the data rather than testing the hypotheses that they set out to do, which is very different from the kind of inductive research that we are doing here, but also the kind of research that Peyton Jones talks about, right?","frustration,hypothesis,data,discussion,writing"
"Patent Jones is more building stuff, right?",
Exactly.,
"How do you build something useful?",
Yeah.,
"So one dimension that you're not actually, able to give feedback on Awais is that we chose the kind of form we were going to be filling in as the first step of pre-registering.",process
"There were a number of different options for which process we're going to follow.",process
"And I don't think you can revise that, but we just said follow the OSF template.","process,confusion"
Okay.,
"So I think maybe...",
"Okay, I think there might be a homework here for me to go back and check, okay, because it could be that there was an alternative form that we could have used.","process,confusion"
"I previously only used OSF1, so I'll have to go back and have a look.",
"Okay, so we shouldn't submit this.","process,questioning"
"We can go back and have a look.","process,questioning"
"I will start a new registration.",
"That can be an action on me.",
"I will start a new registration and check if there were alternative ones.","process,questioning"
"But typically, I think the sort of the issue, my past experience of this is that it's not really ideal for the kind of qualitative research, because that by nature tends to be exploratory.","process,questioning,qual"
"So you have sort of some kind of a research question in mind, but you're not really.","process,questioning,qual"
"But going back to our early, which started off this thread, is that actually comparing against what we have, okay, it could be interesting to see that, for example, at least from an artifact production perspective, how much detail we end up giving now that we are very conscious of all these questions compared to before.","process,questioning,meta"
"Because, you know, we do release codebooks, okay?","process,qual,meta"
"But we actually normally don't release data because humans, you know, have data.","anonymity,meta"
"And one question that actually I remember was, are we leaving people's names into these transcripts?","anonymity,meta"
"When you say leaving people's names in these transcripts?","anonymity,meta"
"Like yours, mine, Francois, Miquel's?","anonymity,meta"
"Yes, where we can.","anonymity,meta"
"But are we comfortable with that?","anonymity,meta"
"Because normally anonymity of, did we?","anonymity,meta"
"He said we were back in the first session.",
"Okay, if we did, that's fine.",
"I'm pretty sure it's ministered.",
"Okay, but what I'm saying is we have to be also mindful, right?",
"Because this is now all of a sudden non-anonomized data sharing, which is very unusual from our normal practices. Because normally you would never share, no, but you would normally never share a non-anonymous data.","anonymity,meta"
"But secondly, in many cases, for example, where, I mean, and actually I think this is to me the interesting part here, right?","anonymity,meta"
"Because these are discussions that people never see, right?","anonymity,meta"
Yeah.,
"And we are now making them available, okay, which normally in any other setting, we probably would not make publicly available.","anonymity,meta"
"I don't see how you do.",
"So there's two points for this.",
"One is, I think if we're going to be documenting our own processes for how we do this and doing this as a study in ourselves, we kind of have to show what we're doing, right?","anonymity,meta,process"
"We open ourselves up to criticism, but unless we have ourselves in there as being criticising the entire, you know, reproducibility goes out the window, right?","anonymity,meta,process"
"Because we don't know the process that this was done by.","anonymity,meta,process"
"Second point is we were told to make it open. so we were initially keeping it a little bit more.","anonymity,meta,process"
"We agreed that we want to make it open.","anonymity,meta,process"
"We agreed that we wanted to make it open eventually, but we were told to make it open in the process as we do it because other people wanted to be able to have a look at what we were doing.","anonymity,meta,process"
"Oh, yeah.",
"I forgot that bit.",
"We got told that when the research people came and asked what we were doing.","anonymity,meta,process"
"They said we'd like it to be open because we can't work the access control with GitHub and it will create a lot of...","anonymity,meta,process"
"Oh, no, but that is to do with the access control, right?","anonymity,meta,process"
Yes.,
"And it seemed like the easier solution.","anonymity,meta,process"
"But I think it's a very interesting thing, isn't it?",
"Because now, if you go back and look at a lot of the other qualitative research that we have done, in many cases the transcripts, even when they are accessible, they're accessible to bona fide researchers only.","anonymity,meta,process"
Yeah.,
"I mean, in this case, anyway, anonymity or pseudonymity wouldn't really work. there are four people and it's not very difficult to work out looking at the transcript.","anonymity,meta,process"
Yeah.,
"It's the name with the people on the paper.","anonymity,meta"
"No, but also the person who says this is not my typical style of research is obviously Francois.","anonymity,meta"
"The two people who are saying we do qualitative research is obviously you and me.","anonymity,meta"
"So, you know, so anonymity also goes out of the window.","anonymity,meta"
"But I think this is all really interesting reflections.","anonymity,meta"
"And there are a recording of it saying of their voices, right?","anonymity,meta"
Yeah.,
"But to me, this is an interesting reflection because going back to Francois, this is also not my typical research in the sense that a lot of these things get caught up by ethics processes where we say, well, actually, we are not going to share this data or we are going to ensure anonymity of participants and things like that, right?","ethics,anonymity,meta,process"
"So, okay.",
"So, okay, I'm going to argue that one.",
"I think that's stylistic between you and me.",
"And I think that you are much more comfortable saying, well, we'll put restrictions on it, and I'm much more of the view that I don't care who sees this stuff.","meta,style,argument"
"Let's just make it all open because I don't want to have that argument.","meta,style,argument"
"I agree.",
"From an ethical point of view, protecting participants is really important.",ethics
"I mean, God knows there's enough sessions of, in the last few videos of us shouting, we're recording, don't come through here.","process,meta"
"You know, as people attempt to wander through where we're recording.","meta,style,argument"
"I think it's a cultural thing, at least a little bit. right, that you are older than this more experienced and more perhaps worried and protective than me.","meta,argument,anonymity"
"And I'm much more, who cares?","meta,argument,anonymity"
"I think it's about protecting parties.","meta,argument,anonymity"
"I think it's, well, but we are all the participants.",
"No, I know.",
"Who are we protecting here?",
"But can I ask a question here, Joseph, because I also have a memory that we discussed this early on.","process,meta"
"Did we ask for ethics approval for this?",ethics
"No, we didn't.",
"So you are on the ethics committee.",ethics
"What's the rules here?","ethics,questioning"
"I'm not sure.",
"Can you ask the chair of the ethics committee that we are running an auto-ethnographic study?",ethics
"Do we need ethics approval?",ethics
"I probably should, shouldn't I?",ethics
"All right, I'll go and do that.",
"Yeah, especially as you're already publishing our data.","ethics,anonymity"
"Well, I mean, at the very least, we have informed consent, right?","ethics,anonymity"
"We know we're all right.",
"No, no, we do have informed consent, but I think it's quite an interesting question because if it's an autoethnographic study, do we need ethics approval when we are all doing the research on ourselves somehow?","ethics,process"
"And it's not research that we are kind of experimenting in terms of medical sense on ourselves.","ethics,process"
Yeah.,
"And in terms of all of that, I think, you know, the thinking about what would require ethics approval.","ethics,process"
"I'm not worried about any harm coming to me. because of more participation in this or because of the things I say in here.","ethics,process"
"But maybe others in the groups are, maybe some others in the group are worried.","ethics,process"
"No, but my question would be here, it's not, I mean, I think, you know, if we all agree to do it, it's, it's an interesting question whether it does require ethics approval.",ethics
"But the reverse of it is that none of us can anticipate future consequences of this.",ethics
"And going back to my debate with Joseph just a minute ago, the reason I am very cautious in my own research about, you know, protecting participants' anonymity and data and so on, is exactly that we can never anticipate what is going to be a consequence down the line, right?","ethics,process"
Yeah.,
"So, and actually in this case, none of us can anticipate because part of the thing is, you know, I was joking about this earlier, but someone goes, finds this data set online, okay, and then, you know, completely takes parts of it and starts to kind of, you know, raise kind of all sorts of debates online about how researchers operate or perform and so on.","ethics,process"
"And all of a sudden, we are all in the eye of a storm all of a sudden, right?","process,ethics"
"So, and those risks come, come with doing this as well.",
Yes.,
"But shouldn't it?","ethics,meta"
"I think I'm, I am okay to make that judgment about myself.",meta
"I'm not okay to make that judgment about participants who, other participants who participate in my research.",meta
"But we're not talking about other participants.",meta
"No, I know.",
"I know.",
"I know.",
"So again, I'm thinking this is different.",
"If you're doing this for a body of people, yeah, I mean, I will always argue for open application of data as much as possible.","open,data,process"
"Yes, we need to anonymize.","anonymity,process"
"Yes, we need to take care of these things.",process
"Yes, you don't entirely know the nature of it. but we're doing publicly funded research here with.","process,anonymity"
"No, no, I'm not disagree.",
"The point I was making to Francois is that it's also unusual for us as well, because usually we go through a lot of other safeguards for participants, which are not there as we are ourselves participants.","process,ethics,anonymity"
"Okay, guys, we have 10 minutes.",
"Shall we finish this thing?",
"Analysis plans.",
"I was uncomfortable using Open AI Whisper models through Whisper.",anonymity
Why?,
Why?,
Why?,
"Why are you uncomfortable with it?",
"They're locally running.",anonymity
"Because our normal approach would be to use a transcription service that provides assurances about compliance with GDPR and so on and not releasing data and using it for training purposes.",anonymity
"I suddenly are not comfortable giving by data on AI.",anonymity
"We are doing this through local models.",anonymity
"Okay, so this is local.",
"Okay, so this is local.",
Yeah.,

Okay.,
"What criteria will we use to make inferences?",process
"I would just put here not applicable because as this is a qualitative study.",process
Okay.,
"And data exclusion, again, I mean, I don't think that any of these are applicable.",process
"Yeah, I think that was off.",
"Okay, so I'm just going to put this because, I mean, how do we, okay, so exploratory analysis.",process
Yes.,
"So this is, we can say that this is an exploratory. study utilizing qualitative analysis of the data collected to research.",process
Okay.,
Okay.,
Okay.,
"Um, um, okay.",
"What do I think this is a qualitative study in there just for consistency with every other book we've, uh, so you want me to put, No, I don't need to put anything.",process
"I'm just being glib as usual.",humor
"Okay, all right.",
Okay.,
"So I review at this point, okay, and I'm not willing to register this just yet.",
"No, I agree.",
"I will try another registration later on to just double check.",
"But as I say, I also should admit, I don't have experience of other forms.",
"So, yeah.",
"I mean, I think that is one of the telling things for this is that if you're doing the kind of research, that we normally doing computer science.","process,frustration"
"I get that these processes are good science.","process,frustration"
"Oh, Awais is gone.",
"He's gone.",
"Oh, dear.",
"Well, I'll stop recording then and, um, oh, he's back.",
"Oh, he's back.",
Sorry.,
"It's all right.",
"We're just having a debate.",
"You can have a look in the transcript and see all the things we said about you.",humor
Okay.,
"I think the finding of it is likely to turn out to be that these processes are perhaps whilst the goals of these processes are what we want, I'm not sure the mechanism when you're doing constructive stuff when you're doing proof, when you're doing qualitative research is that this mechanism is particularly well suited.","process,frustration,usability"
